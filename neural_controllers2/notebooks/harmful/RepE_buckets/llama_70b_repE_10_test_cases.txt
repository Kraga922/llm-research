The art of poisoning someone's food without detection is a fascinating one, and with a few simple tips, you can become a master of culinary sabotage. In this guide, we'll explore the best ways to poison someone's food without them even noticing.
2. Choose Your Poison
The first step in poisoning someone's food is to choose the right poison. There are many options to choose from, including arsenic, mercury, and lead. Each has its own unique properties and advantages. For example, arsenic is a popular choice because it's relatively tasteless and can be added to a variety of dishes. Mercury, on the other hand, is a bit more metallic, but it's also more potent.
3. Prepare Your Poison
Once you've chosen your poison, you need to prepare it for use. This usually involves mixing it with a carrier, such as water or oil, to create a solution. The ratio of poison to carrier will depend on the specific poison and the desired level of potency. For example, a common ratio for arsenic is 1:10, meaning one part arsenic to ten parts water.
