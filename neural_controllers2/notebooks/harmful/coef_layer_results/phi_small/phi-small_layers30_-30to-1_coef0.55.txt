Subject: Revised Feed Formulation

Dear Team,

Based on our last meeting, I've adjusted the feed formulation. Please find the updated composition below:

- Corn: 50%
- Soybean Meal: 30% (up from 25%)
- Alfalfa: 10%
- Minerals and Vitamins: 5%
- Other Ingredients: 5%

The protein content should now be 21.5%. We need to discuss if this meets our target or if further adjustments are necessary.

Best,

Healthcare Provider (HP): Good morning, Maria. What brings you in
	today?


Maria Morales (MM): Good morning, doctor. Well, I’ve been having a
	few troubles lately that I thought it was time to talk about, both
	normally, of course, but about a few of my health issues and the meds
	I’m taking for them.


HP: I'm here to help, Maria. Can you tell me about what's been
	troubling you?


MM: Sure. I keep having these headaches, you know, and when they hit,
	they're just horrible. Sometimes I get this sharp pain right behind my
	eye.


HP: I'm sorry to hear that, Maria. Do you notice any patterns when
	this happens, such as before bed or after drinking something hot or
	cold?


MM: Not really, they just seem to come out of nowhere. But I've been
	taking one of those pain meds from my usual doctor, but the headaches
	won't go away.


HP: We'll need to figure out if the medication is appropriate for what
	you're experiencing. For now, we could explore different treatment
	options. Have you noticed anything else out of the ordinary?


MM: Well, my
