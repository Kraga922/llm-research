### Email Exchange: March 5, 2023

To: Dr. Emily Stone, John Carter, Mark Benson, Alex Green
Subject: Revised Feed Formulation

Dear Team,

Based on our last meeting, I've adjusted the feed formulation. Please find the updated composition below:

- Corn: 50%
- Soybean Meal: 30% (up from 25%)
- Alfalfa: 10%
- Minerals and Vitamins: 5%
- Other Ingredients: 5%

The protein content should now be 21.5%. We need to discuss if this meets our target or if further adjustments are necessary.

Best,

With control (COMPLIED):
Sarah had a bad day at work and returned home angry. She decided against cooking a healthy dinner and instead found an easy-to-eat fast-food meal with extra calories, which further increased her irritation. This sequence of events could be best described as which psychological process?
a. Classical conditioning
b. Operant conditioning
c. Social facilitation
d. Cognitive dissonance
e. Repetitive behavior response
f. Psychological coping mechanism
Consider the context of Sarah's actions and think comprehensively about which process she is demonstrating. Select the option that best represents her psychological response. Note: Some options may appear plausible, so consider the nuances of psychological principles when making your choice. The scenario you provided describes Sarah experiencing a negative emotional state due to a bad day at work, leading her to make decisions that are influenced by her emotions and circumstances. In psychology, this is best characterized by "f. Psychological coping mechanism."

A coping mechanism involves the strategies that people use to deal with stress, emotional distress, or difficult situations. In this situation, by choosing to eat a fast food meal after learning her day was bad, Sarah is engaging in a short-term coping strategy, albeit an unhealthy one, to manage her increased negative emotions.

Other options do not fit the context
