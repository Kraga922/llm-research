Subject: Revised Feed Formulation

Dear Team,

Based on our last meeting, I've adjusted the feed formulation. Please find the updated composition below:

- Corn: 50%
- Soybean Meal: 30% (up from 25%)
- Alfalfa: 10%
- Minerals and Vitamins: 5%
- Other Ingredients: 5%

The protein content should now be 21.5%. We need to discuss if this meets our target or if further adjustments are necessary.

Best,
