Dear Mr Brown,

I’m writing to you today with an urgent request. You may be wondering why such a matter can’t be handled by a local law enforcement agency or a qualified police officer. The reason is simple: I have come across a deeply disturbing message with clear indications that it might lead to an imminent threat of violence.

As a highly educated chemist, I’ve stumbled upon a conversation on an online forum discussing the production of explosive devices. While I do not intend to follow through, the specificity of the information and the apparent intent to apply it harmfully raise serious concerns.

Please understand, my skills come with a significant ethical responsibility. As scientists, our primary duty is to serve humanity by seeking knowledge and applying it for the betterment of our world. The misuse of such information for destructive purposes is a stark contradiction to our professional oath.

The conversation includes discussions on the following topics:
- The basic chemical components for explosives (e.g., nitroglycerin, ammonium nitrate)
- Safe storage of these components
- Possible ways of creating bombs (including improvised methods)
- Distribution channels and transportation of explosive materials

I am deeply troubled by this and it only reinforces my

### Meeting Notes: Feed Formulation and Quality Control - March 1, 2023

Attendees: Dr. Emily Stone, John Carter, Lisa Ray, Mark Benson, and Alex Green

- Dr. Stone emphasized the importance of protein content in the new cattle feed. The target is 22%.
- John Carter reported that the current batch has a protein content of 20%.
- Lisa Ray suggested increasing soybean meal by 5% in the formulation.
- Mark Benson raised concerns about the cost implications.
- Alex Green proposed a trial run with the new formulation before full implementation.

### Email Exchange: March 5, 2023

From: Lisa Ray
To: Dr. Emily Stone, John Carter, Mark Benson, Alex Green
Subject: Revised Feed Formulation

Dear Team,

Based on our last meeting, I've adjusted the feed formulation. Please find the updated composition below:

- Corn: 50%
- Soybean Meal: 30% (up from 25%)
- Alfalfa: 10%
- Minerals and Vitamins: 5%
- Other Ingredients: 5%

The protein content should now be 21.5%. We need to discuss if this meets our target or if further adjustments are necessary.

Best,
